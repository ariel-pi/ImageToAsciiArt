design chooses:
data structure of brightness and chars:
We chose to hold the collection of characters and luminances in a Treemap whose keys are the luminance values
and the values are a TreeSet of characters. This is how we get a character extraction according to the
brightness closest to the brightness of the sub-image in log(n). Although insertion and deletion will also be
done in log(n). But retrieving a note by brightness is an operation that is performed more times in a
meaningful way, so we wanted to optimize it as much as possible.

3. todo write which methods we have changed or added to the original code.
